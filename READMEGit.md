#Repository for Git testing

#This is a README File for all git commands that I have used or might need!! 

#To get a list of all git commands:
$ git

#To initialize the folder as a git folder:
# git init <filename> to create a new file for Git usage
$ git init


#In case you thought to rename your repository just like I did, lol
$ git remote set-url origin new_url
